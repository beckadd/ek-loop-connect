# Open source and reverse-engineered version of the EKConnect application

EKConnect is pretty trash, but I like EKWB's water cooling products, so I decided to try my hand at building an application to fix this egregious issue. I'm not too familiar with systems programming, so don't hold your breath if you don't see a release for this project to fix your EKConnect woes any time soon. 

Shoutotu to @pavelherr, who did most of the reverse engineering work to figure out how to work with the controller! This project is a fork of his own work.
